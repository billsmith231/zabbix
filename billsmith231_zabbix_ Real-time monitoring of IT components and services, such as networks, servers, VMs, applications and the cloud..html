<p dir="auto">An enterprise-class, open-source distributed monitoring solution that’s designed to monitor the performance and availability of network devices, servers, services, and other IT resources.
Zabbix is a flexible solution that can monitor anything from a simple, standalone application to a large-scale environment, with features including:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Resource discovery:</strong> Discover network entities, server resources, and onboard/offboard devices. Use out-of-the-box integrations (templates) to monitor anything form a low-level device to a SAAS service.</li>
<li><strong>Metric acquisition:</strong> Use an agent or agent-less approach for metric acquisition from any source – devices, sensors, operating systems, virtualization platforms, container platforms like Docker, Kubernetes, cloud infrastructures, databases, webpages, Java ecosystems, application servers, API endpoints, business applications, and many more.</li>
<li><strong>Root cause analysis and problem detection:</strong> Count on high-performance, real-time problem detection that correlates both existing and incoming problems and performs root cause analyses.</li>
<li><strong>Incidents, alerts, and notifications:</strong> Receive an alert when an issue is triggered (proactively or post-mortem) in the ecosystem. Use multiple messaging channels (including Slack, JIRA, Microsoft Teams, email or text messages) to get notified about the different types of events occurring in your environment.</li>
<li><strong>“Single pane of glass” overview:</strong> Visualize collected data and monitoring events in graphs, lists, geomaps, and network topology maps.</li>
<li><strong>Multitenancy and distributed monitoring:</strong> Enjoy the convenience of one monitoring solution for multiple data centers, departments, and organizations, and monitor remote locations behind firewalls with remote command execution capability.</li>
<li><strong>Unparalleled flexibility:</strong> Adapt Zabbix to your needs and utilize built-in functionalities, including the ability to stream metrics and events over HTTP, reporting, auditing, security, service SLA calculations, and many more.</li>
